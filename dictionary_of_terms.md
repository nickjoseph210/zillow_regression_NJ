## Glossary of Terms

Several features in the provided data needed some clarification for me.  While not exhaustive, this is the segment in which I hope to keep track of their definitions:

**fips number / code**
- short for Federal Information Processing Standard
- it's a unique identifier for US counties / county equivalents
- composed of five numbers: first two are the state code, and the last three digits are the county code
- our database lists them as four-number codes; this is due to the first number being the placeholder zero(0)
