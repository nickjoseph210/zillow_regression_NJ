## Full Disclosure

I came up short on this project because I got lost in the process.

It is now 6:30 am and I've been working (nearly) non-stop for the past four days.

Everything seemed to be going well until I had to compare models against baselines with yhats and ybars.  Could not seem to wrap my mind around that stuff, and by the time I moved on to distribution of taxes, I was just lost.  I felt like I'd exhausted my life-lines, getting to the point of being a bother to the rest of the cohort.

I will revisit this project before the end of this cohort, and have a better, more complete project then.

## Data for the presentation

I performed enough analysis to come to a couple of conclusions, which will be seen in the presentation, however much of it will be (was) based on just online research, namely the net total property tax collections for Los Angeles, Orange, and Ventura counties (link: https://www.boe.ca.gov/annual/2016-17/table_17/Table5-16-17.pdf)
